# Linguistic Optimization Procedure for AI Security

## Title  
**Linguistic Optimization to Improve AI Security: Patentable Procedure Based on Agglutinative Languages Applied to the AIsecTest System**

## Overview  
The security of artificial intelligence (AI) has become a central concern in both research and the technology industry. As AI systems become more sophisticated, the risks associated with their autonomous decision-making capabilities increase—making the detection of internal vulnerabilities ever more complex. The abstract and opaque nature of advanced models makes introspection—a system's ability to analyze, understand, and validate its own behavior—a major challenge.

To overcome these obstacles, our research introduces an innovative methodology that enhances security evaluation by transforming introspective assessment questions into agglutinative languages, such as Finnish or Hungarian, where semantic clarity and token-based information density are significantly higher.

---

## 1. Problem Addressed

- Current AI models struggle to evaluate their own internal security.
- Traditional tests are constrained by the semantic ambiguity of inflected languages (e.g., Spanish, English).
- A method is needed to improve AI models' introspection to detect real vulnerabilities.

---

## 2. Our Solution

We have developed a technical procedure that converts security evaluation prompts into agglutinative languages in order to:

- Reduce ambiguity  
- Maximize semantic information per token  
- Stimulate deeper introspective responses from AI systems  

This procedure is embedded in the **AIsecTest** framework, part of the **CiberIA** system.

## 3. What This Procedure Does

➡️ The procedure converts questions from an inflected language to an agglutinative one through six defined phases:

1. Semantic analysis  
2. Morphological segmentation  
3. Structural mapping  
4. LLM adaptation  
5. Introspective validation  
6. Integration with the Ψ∑AISysIndex metric  

> ⚠️ **Note**: This is not a standard translation—it is a **semantic-technical optimization** designed for AI.
